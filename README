libbsa is the standard library for bscc, the Brainsick code compiler.

libbsa is free software; see the file COPYING for the full text of the
license.  You may notice that libbsa compiles to a .dll file.  DLLs are
generally known as dynamically linked libraries for the proprietary
Microsoft Windows operating system.  However, libbsa fully works on
Wine, which runs on GNU/Linux.  Wine is free software.

The file INSTALL contains instructions on building and installing this
library.

See the file NEWS for information on user-visible changes to this
library.
