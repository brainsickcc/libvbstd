Compilation and installation guide

These instructions should work on modern Unix-like systems.

First, install bscc plus its other runtime dependencies.  bscc should be
available whence you obtained libbsa.  Next, from your package manager,
install the program ``llc''; this will be in a package named ``LLVM'' or
similar.

Now you can run
  $ make
in this directory to compile this library.

Next, to install this library, run
  $ sudo PREFIX=/usr/local make install
or equivalently
  $ su
  # PREFIX=/usr/local make install
If you do not specify PREFIX, it will default to /usr/local.  Whilst you
can specify another prefix, this is of limited use: the compiler bscc
can only make use of this library if it is installed with the default
PREFIX.
